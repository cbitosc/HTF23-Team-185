        <h5>Team AdoPaw</h5>
          <p>On this beautiful place called Earth, every being has right to live a happy life.  Animals like dogs and cats are made to be the friendly companions to humans, which are loyal and friendly towards their people.But when these animals are left to the streets, they may grow aggressive which is dangerous to the human colonies or they may die with uncertain reasons which spread infections to the people.
            Hence we, the AdoPaw crew are here to help the people as well as the animals that are abandoned.Here you can contact us when you find an animal that need to be resued or that has to be adopted.And also you can adopt the pets as per your requirement.Your adoption can give a happy life by turning the homeless animals into the friendly pets</p>
